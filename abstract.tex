\begin{abstract}
	Investigating the homotopy groups of the fixed point spectra of iterated topological Hochschild homology of a commutative ring spectrum, we study the resulting Burnside-Witt complexes and prove the existence of an initial such complex, the de Rham Burnside-Witt complex. We proceed to analyse this algebraic object and compare it to the afore mentioned homotopy groups for the ring $\rH\bF_p$.
