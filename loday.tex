\section{Iterated THH - Loday Functor}
  We proceed to introduce topological Hochschild homology based on a space $X$ and the structure it carries for $X = T^n$ the $n$-dimensional torus, following \cite{brun2010covering} as well as \cite{carlsson2011higher}. For details on bicategories, confer \cite{benabou1967introduction}.\\

  \subsection{Spans of finite sets}

  \begin{defn}\label{def_cateogry_of_spans}
    The category of spans $V$ has as objects the class of finite sets, while the morphism set $V(X,Y)$ for two finite sets $X,Y$ is given by the set of equivalence classes of diagrams called spans of the form $X \ot A \to Y$. Two such diagrams $X \ot A \to Y$, $X \ot A^\prime \to Y$ are said to be equivalent if there is a bijection $A \to A^\prime$ making the resulting triangles commute. The identity on $X$ is given by $[ X = X = X]$. To compose two maps represented by $[X \ot A \to Y]$ and $[Y \ot B \to Z]$, we take a pullback $A \ot C \to B$ of $A \to Y \ot B$ and compose with the maps $X \to A$, $B \to Z$ to obtain $[X \ot C \to W]$. Since we take equivalence classes of spans, this is well-defined, and it is straight-forward to check that this forms a category using the universal property of pull-backs.
  \end{defn}

  \begin{lem}\label{lem_coproduct_product_in_V}
    The product and coproduct in V are given by disjoint union.
    % \begin{proof}
      % Explain structure morphisms, comment on / explain universal properties
    % \end{proof}
  \end{lem}

  \begin{defn}\label{defn_group_acting_on_object_in_V_morphism_phi}
    Given a finite set $Y$ with a left action of a group $G$, we define the action on $Y$ through automorphisms in $V$ by mapping $g \mapsto [Y \myleftarrow{\id_Y} Y \myrightarrow{g} Y]$, which can easily be seen to be a left action. Thus $G$ also acts (from the left) on $V(X,Y)$ for any finite set $X$, by functoriality. We define a function
    \begin{gather*}
      \phi: V(X,Y/G) \to V(X,Y)^G \\
      [X \ot A \to Y/G] \mapsto [X \ot A \x_{Y/G} Y \to Y].
    \end{gather*}
    This function is bijective.
  \end{defn}

  % \begin{prop}\label{prop_phi_V(Y,X/G)_to_V(Y,X)^G_is_bijective}
  %   The function $\phi$ defined above is bijective.

  \begin{defn}\label{def_bicategory}
    A bicategory $\cC$ consists of the following data:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A class of objects, or 0-cells, of $\cC$, denoted $\cC_0$;
      \item For any two objects $c, d \in \cC_0$ a category $\cC(c,d)$ whose objects $c \myrightarrow{f} d$ are called 1-morphisms, or 1-cells of $\cC$, and whose morphisms

      are called 2-morphisms, or 2-cells of $\cC$.
      \item For any three objects $c,d,e \in \cC_0$ a functor $\cC(d,e) \times \cC(c,d) \to \cC(c,e)$, called composition, and written as
      \begin{gather*}

      \item For each object $c \in \cC_0$ a 1-morphism $1_c \in \cC(c,c)$, taking the role of the identity on $c$;
      \item For each triple $a\myrightarrow{f}b\myrightarrow{g}c\myrightarrow{h}d$ of 1-morphisms an isomorphism in the category $\cC(a,d)$%

  \begin{rem}
    The composition of 2-arrows induced by the composition functor is denoted by an asteriks as 2-arrows enjoy an internal composition stemming from the fact that they are morphisms in a category, namely $\cC(c,d)$ for two objects $c,\,d$ of a bicategory $\cC$. Drawing out the diagrams involved in the definition of functoriality for the composition functor,
    \begin{gather*}

    A lax functor is called \emph{weak} or \emph{strict} if the structure maps $\phi_{g,f}$ and $\phi_a$ are isomorphisms or identity morphisms, respectively, for all composable $g,f$ and all $a \in \cC_0$. Note that there is a dual notion of colax functor, which we do not need. We will hence drop the word lax from our notation. It is a lengthy but rather straight forward exercise to verify that the composition of two composable 2-functors is again a 2-functor.

  \begin{defn}\label{def_bicategory_of_spans}
    The bicategory of spans of finite sets, denoted $W$, has as objects the class of finite sets. Given two finite sets $X,Y$, we define the morphism category $W(X,Y)$ to have as objects spans $f = (Y \myleftarrow{f_1} A \myrightarrow{f_2} X)$, while a morphism between two spans $\alpha: f \to g$ with $g = (Y \myleftarrow{g_1} B \myrightarrow{g_2} X)$ is given by a map $\alpha: A \to B$ making the triangles in the following diagram commute:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \xymatrix@R-1em@C+1em{
        %
        &
        A
          \ar[dl]_{f_1}
          \ar[dd]_{\alpha}
          \ar[dr]^{f_2}

        %
      }
    \end{displaymath}
    and composition of these is the usual composition of maps, forming a category. The composition functor $W(X,Y) \times W(Y,Z) \to W(X,Z)$ may be described as follows: We begin with a diagram representing spans $(f,g), (f^\prime, g^\prime) \in W(X,Y) \times W(Y,Z)$ and morphisms of spans $\alpha: f \to f^\prime$, $\beta: g \to g^\prime$:

    In this situation, we take the (functorial!) pullback of $A \myrightarrow{f_2} Y \myleftarrow{g_1} B$ given by $A \ot A \times_Y B \to B$ with %
    $A \times_Y B = \{(a,b) \in A \times B \with f_2(a) = g_1(b) \in Y \}$ and the two maps induced by the respective projections. Composing with $f_1$ and $g_2$ we obtain a new span $X \ot A \times_Y B \to Z)$, and applying the same construction to the lower part of diagram \ref{diag_composition_functor_in_W} one may observe that the maps $\alpha$ and $\beta$ induce a map $\alpha \times_Y \beta: A \times_Y \beta \to A^\prime \times_Y B^\prime$ which we take as the definition of $\beta \ast \alpha$. The functorial choice of pullback assures that this in fact defines a functor.\\
    The identity 1-morphism associated to a finite set $X$ is the span %
    \begin{displaymath}
      1_X = (\xymatrix{ X & X \ar@{=}[l] \ar@{=}[r] & X});
    \end{displaymath}
    The associativity coherence isomorphism is the natural isomorphism describing associativity of the pullback, while the identity coherence isomorphisms $\lambda_f: 1_Y \circ f \Longrightarrow f$ and $\rho_f: f \circ 1_X \Longrightarrow f$ for a span $f=(X\ot~A\to~Y)$ are given by the isomorphisms $A \times_Y Y \to A$ and $X \times_X A \to A$ respectively, both induced by the projection onto $A$, hence natural. Commutativity of the pentagon and triangle diagrams in this context is self-evident.

  \begin{defn}\label{def_subcategories_of_epimorphisms_and_isomorphisms}
    We define two sub-bicategories $iW \subset eW \subset W$ which differ from $W$ only in the 2-morphisms: while $eW$ only permits those 2-morphisms in $W$ that are epimorphisms, $iW$ only permits isomorphisms.
  \end{defn}


  % TODO can we formulate the two following remarks as a statement of adjoint functors? Is the discrete functor from categories to strict bicategories a left-adjoint? is the right-adjoint the forgetful functor, if the latter is well-defined? are we talking functors of categories, or 2-categories? this should be written somewhere... let the functor take values in strict, locally small (i.e. morphism categories are small) categories, then we have a forgetful functor, at least on objects. haven't checked morphisms (or 2-morphisms)! adjoint? don't know...
  \begin{rem}\label{rem_discrete_bicategory}
    Given a category $\cC$ we may define a bicategory $\cC^\prime$ by taking the 0-cells to be the objects of $\cC^\prime$, i.e. $\cC^\prime_0 \defas \ob \cC$, and by letting the discrete category formed by the morphisms $\cC(c,d)$ between two objects $c,d \in \ob \cC$ be the morphism category $\cC^\prime(c,d)$. We let composition and identity 1-arrows be composition and identity morphisms in $\cC$, and choose structure morphisms (necessarily) to be identities. This definition then satisfies the axioms of a strict bicategory, and will be referred to as discrete bicategory on $\cC$.
  \end{rem}

  \begin{rem}\label{rem_discrete_bicategories_functors}
    Let $F: \cC \to \cD$ be a functor between two categories. We define a lax functor between the discrete bicategories on $\cC$ and $\cD$, $F^\prime: \cC^\prime \to \cD^\prime$, by using the given assignments for objects and 1-morphisms, noting that assignment of 2-morphisms is forced by the axioms of a functor since the only 2-morphisms are identities, and choosing the structure morphisms as identities. We thus obtain a strict functor of bicategories.
  \end{rem}

  \begin{defn}\label{def_lax_functor_V_to_eW}
    We may consider $V$, the category of spans of finite sets, as a bicategory by making the set of morphisms $V(X,Y)$ between two finite sets into a category with only identity morphisms, also called a discrete category (cf. \ref{rem_discrete_bicategory}). With this we may define a lax functor $L: V \to W$ as follows: We map finite sets to themselves, and map a class of spans $f = [X \myleftarrow{f_1} A \myrightarrow{f_2} Y]$ with indicated representative to the span $ L(f) = (X \ot LA \to{Y})$, where 
    \begin{displaymath}
      LA \defas \{ (x,y) \in X \times Y \with \exists a \in A : f_1(a) = x,\; f_2(a) = y \} = \im (f_1,f_2)
    \end{displaymath}
    and the two maps are induced by the respective projections. One may immediately verify that this definition does not depend on the representative. As $V$ only has identity 2-morphisms, these are necessarily sent to the respective identities in $W$. Given another 1-arrow in $V$, $g = [y \myleftarrow{g_1} B \myrightarrow{g_2} Z]$, we observe that the structure map $L(g) \circ L(f) \to L(g \circ f)$ is given by projecting away from $Y$ in $LA \times_Y LB \to L(A \times_Y B)$, $((x,y),(y,z)) \mapsto (x,z)$ and is at most an epimorphism, i.e. there are examples where this map fails to be injective. The structure morphism for identity morphisms is given by the diagonal $X \to LX = \im (\id_X, \id_X)$, hence we indeed map to $eW$, the subcategory of epimorphic 2-morphisms of $W$. The diagram relating associativity and functoriality structure morphisms commutes, as only projections and rearraging of parantheses are involved. For the unit structure morphisms the reader may convince herself that the map $L(f \circ 1_X) \to L(f)$ is the identity, or rather that the sets $L(X \times_X A)$ and $LA$ are equal, which implies the commutativity of the respective diagram, and a similar argument holds for the dual situation. 
  \end{defn}

  \begin{defn}\label{def_functors_finite_sets_to_iW}
    There are two functors $\Fin \to V$, $\Fin^\op \to V$, given by sending $f:X \to Y$ to $ f_* = [ X = X \myrightarrow{f} Y]$ and $ f^* = [ Y \myleftarrow{f} X = X ]$, respectively. It is straightforward to check that these are functorial. As described in Remark \ref{rem_discrete_bicategories_functors}, we may interpret these as functors of bicategories. Composing each with $L: V \to W$ we note that we obtain weak functors, or equivalently that the compositions have image in $iW$.
  \end{defn}

  % TODO work on this remark
  We are now going to define an abstraction of the Loday functor as it is known on finite sets. It helps to remember the combinatorics of the basic example, as apart from bookkeeping, not much more is going on here. To this end, recall that the Loday functor based on a commutative ring $A$
  \begin{displaymath}
    \Lambda A: \Fin \to \Ab
  \end{displaymath}
  is given by assigning to a map of finite sets $f: X \to Y$ the map of abelian groups $A^X \to A^Y$ which sends a tuple $(a_x)_{x \in X}$ to the tuple $(b_y)_{y \in Y}$ with 
  \begin{displaymath}
    b_y \defas \prod_{x \in f^{-1}(y)} a_x,
  \end{displaymath}
  where the above product is interpreted as the unit in $A$ whenever taken over the empty set. After this digression, we formulate
  
  \begin{defn}\label{def_functor_iW_to_Cat_aka_abstract_loday}
    Let $\cB$ be a category with chosen finite coproducts, and we let $\cC \subset \cB$ be a subcategory that contains all isomorphisms in $\cB$, in particular it has all objects of $\cB$. Define a weak functor of bicategories
    \begin{displaymath}
      \cC: iW \to \Cat
    \end{displaymath}
    by sending a finite set $X$ to $\cC(X) \defas \cC^X$, the $X$-fold product of $\cC$ with itself. Given a span $f = (X \myleftarrow{f_1} A \myrightarrow{f_2} Y)$, we define a functors
    \begin{displaymath}
      \cC(f): \cC(X) = \cC^X \to \cC^Y = \cC(Y)
    \end{displaymath}
    by assigning to a $(c: X \to \ob \cC) \in \ob \cC^X$ (a tuple, written as a map) the object 
    \begin{displaymath}
      \cC(f)(c): Y \to \cC, y \mapsto \coprod_{a \in f_2^{-1}(y)} c(f_1(a)).
    \end{displaymath}
    For a map of tupels $\phi: c \to c^\prime$, the same formula may be used to define $\cC(\phi)$. Recall that $\phi \in \prod_{x \in X} \cC(c(x),c^\prime(x))$. With this, we may define the $y$-th coordinate of $\cC(f)(\phi):\cC(f)(c) \to \cC(f)(c^\prime)$ as the map
    \begin{displaymath}
      \coprod_{a \in f_2^{-1}(y)} c(f_1(a))%
        \crightarrow{2.5}{\coprod_{a \in f_2^{-1}(y)} \phi(f_1(a))}%
      \coprod_{a \in f_2^{-1}(y)} c^\prime(f_1(a)).%
    \end{displaymath}
    It's straightforward to check that this is indeed a functor.\\
    %
    For an invertible two-morphism $\alpha: f \to f^\prime = (X \myleftarrow{f_1^\prime} A^\prime \myrightarrow{f_2^\prime} Y)$ of spans, we need a natural transformation of functors $\cC(f) \Rightarrow \cC(f^\prime): \cC^X \to \cC^Y$, i.e. for every object $c \in \cC^X$ a natural morphism in $\cC^Y$, $\cC(f)(c) \to \cC(f^\prime)(c)$. For every $y \in Y$ we are seeking a morphism
    \begin{displaymath}
      \coprod_{a \in f_2^{-1}(y)} c(f_1(a)) \to%
        %\crightarrow{2.5}{\coprod_{a \in f_2^{-1}(y)} \phi(f_1(a))}%
      \coprod_{a^\prime \in (f^\prime_2)^{-1}(y)} c(f^\prime_1(a^\prime)).%
    \end{displaymath}
    To see that we may choose such a morphism naturally with respect to $c$, we observe that $\alpha: A \to A^\prime$ is a bijection, as $\alpha$ is an invertible 2-morphism, in particular $\alpha$ induces a bijection of sets $f_2^{-1}(y) \to (f_2^\prime)^{-1}(y)$ by $a \mapsto \alpha(a)$, and we also have $f^\prime_1(\alpha(a)) = f_1(a) \in X$, hence there is a natural (in $c$) isomorphism as we desire, induced by $\alpha$, and given as a reordering of summands in the coproduct.\\
    Note that we could not define this functor for instance with domain $W$ or $eW$, as we only assumed $\cC$ to have all isomorphisms of $\cB$: The coproducts used here are formed in $\cC$, and may not coincide with coproducts in $\cB$. By assuring that the maps we obtain via the universal property of the coproducts (in $\cB$!) are isomorphisms, we may assume that they are already morphisms in $\cC$.\\
    %
    Given two composable spans $f = (X \myleftarrow{f_1} A \myrightarrow{f_2} Y)$, %
    $g = (Y \myleftarrow{g_1} B \myrightarrow{g_2} Z)$, we specify the natural isomorphism $ \phi_{g,f}: \cC(g) \circ \cC(f) \to \cC(g \circ f)$ by considering (just plug in the definitions) that we should find a map as follows for a $c: X \to \ob \cC$ and any $z \in Z$:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \coprod_{b \in g_2^{-1}(z)}\left( \coprod_{a \in f_2^{-1}(g_1(b))} c(f_1(a)) \right) \to %
      \coprod_{(a,b) \in (g_2 \circ \pr_B)^{-1}(z)} c(f_1 \circ \pr_A(a,b)),
    \end{displaymath}
    where the left hand side corresponds to composition of functors, while the right hand side represents compositon of spans (given by pullback). Now we simply note that $f_1 \circ \pr_A(a,b) = f_1(b)$, and that the indexing sets for the two coproducts coincide, or in formulas:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \{ (a,b) \with g_2(b) = z,\, f_2(a) = g_1(b) \} = \{ (a,b) \in A \times_Y B \with g_2(b) = z \},
    \end{displaymath}
    hence we may again find a natural isomorphism given by rearranging the summands as necessary.\\
    %
    The 2-morphism $\phi_X: 1_{\cC(X)} \to \cC(1_X)$ can be chosen as the identity natural transformation, as the two endofunctors of $\cC^X$ coincide.\\
    %
    As $\Cat$ is a strict category and the unit structure morphism is the identity, only the associativity of the composition structure morphism is to be checked, which is straight-forward, hence the axioms for a functor of bicategories are satisfied by the just defined structure.
  \end{defn}

  \begin{defn}\label{def_pointed_stuff}
    We define a \emph{pointed category} to be a category $\cC$ with a chosen object, called the null or zero object and denoted $0$, which is both initial and final in $\cC$. We note that a pointed category is enriched over pointed sets. Indeed we may choose the unique morphism factoring through the zero object in each morphism set, and note that this makes composition a map of pointed sets.\\
    A \emph{pointed functor} is a functor of pointed categories that preserves zero objects.\\
    Given two pointed categories $\cC$ and $\cD$, we may define another pointed category $\cC \smash \cD$ by taking the smash products of object and morphism sets, respectively. It is easy to convince oneself that this again constitutes a pointed category.\\
    We would like to note a particular example at this point that we will come to use later. Given a pointed category $\cC$, we let $\cC^e \defas \cC^{\op} \smash \cC$. This might remind one of the notation for the enveloping algebra $A^{e} = A^{\op} \otimes A$ of a unital and associative algebra, and indeed there is a connection which we point out in Rem. \ref{rem_connection_to_algebras}.

  \begin{defn}\label{def_added_basepoint_extending_functor}
    Consider the bicategory of small pointed categories $\Cat_*$ with functors and natural transformations, and the (strict) forgetful functor down to categories $\Cat_* \to \Cat$. This functor has a left adjoint, denoted
    \begin{displaymath}
      (-)_+ : \Cat \to \Cat_*,
    \end{displaymath}
    sending a category $\cC$ to the category $\cC_+$ which compared to $\cC$ has an extra object $0$, the adjoint basepoint, and extra morphisms $c \to 0$ and $0 \to c$ for every object $c \in \cC_0$. Functors and natural transformations of categories are uniquely extended to their respective pointed versions. A simple verification of the axioms shows that this defines a strict 2-functor, and the adjointness is also straight-forward.
  \end{defn}

  \begin{defn}\label{def_extending_functor_iW_to_Cat_to_pointed_version}
    Given a weak functor of bicategories $F: iW \to \Cat$, we would like to extend this functor along the inclusion $\iota: iW \to eW$ to a weak functor $F_+: eW \to \Cat_*$ as displayed in the following diagram:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \xymatrix{
        iW
          \ar[d]_{F}
          \ar[r]^{\iota}
        &
        eW
          \ar[d]^{F_+}
        \\

          \ar[r]_{(-)_+}
        &
        \Cat_*
      }
    \end{displaymath}
    where the bottom arrow refers to the functor found in Def. \ref{def_pointed_stuff}. The value of $F_+$ on objects, 1-arrows and invertible 2-arrows is determined if we ask for the above diagram to commute. Hence we merely need to indicate the images of non-invertible 2-arrows in $eW$ under $F_+$. We send these to the zero natural transformation, i.e. the transformation that is given on any object as the unique map factoring through the zero object. This is in fact a weak functor: All necessary data is given, and the assignment of 1-arrows and 2-arrows is a functor, as composition with the zero transformation results in the zero transformation (only need to check what happens for non-invertible two-arrows). For the axioms, note that the structure morphisms of $F_+$ are the uniquely determined pointed extensions of the structure morphisms of $F$, namely natural transformations extended by the identity on the zero object. In particular the axioms are satisfied and the structure morphisms are isomorphisms.
  \end{defn}

  \begin{defn}\label{def_J_and_functors_from_finite_sets_to_pointed_categories}
    Consider the skeletal category $\cF$ of finite sets, i.e. the full subcategory of finite sets with objects given by sets of the form $\{1, \ldots, n\}$, for all $n \geq 0$ (taking the empty set for $n=0$). We may choose a finite coproduct on this category with the property that for any set $X \in \cF$ and any singleton set $\{*\}$, we have 
    \begin{displaymath}
      \coprod_{\{*\}} X = X,
    \end{displaymath}
    for example by induction, choosing a well-ordering on every finite set.\\
    We let $\cI$ be the subcategory of $\cF$ given by all inclusions (in particular, all objects of $\cF$ are in $\cI$) and apply the constructions described in Def. \ref{def_functor_iW_to_Cat_aka_abstract_loday} (abstract Loday functor) by setting $\cC \defas \cI$ as well as Def. \ref{def_extending_functor_iW_to_Cat_to_pointed_version} (adding a basepoint) to obtain a weak functor 
    \begin{displaymath}
      \cI_+: eW \to \Cat, X \mapsto (\cI^X)_+.
    \end{displaymath}
    We continue by precomposing with the lax functor $L: V \to eW$ defined in Def. \ref{def_lax_functor_V_to_eW} (sending a class of spans $[X \ot A \to Y]$ to $(X \ot LA \to Y)$), resulting in 
    \begin{displaymath}
      \cJ \defas L \cI_+: V \to \Cat_*
    \end{displaymath}
    which still sends a set $X \mapsto \cJ(X) = (\cI^X)_+$.\\
    Finally we may precompose with the inclusions of the (opposite) category of finite sets to $V$, obtaining two different functors: Taking the covariant inclusion $\Fin \to V$ mapping an $f:X \to Y$ to the class of spans $[ (X = X \myrightarrow{f} Y) ]$ yields a weak functor
    \begin{gather*}
      \Fin \to \Cat_*,\\% 
      ( X \myrightarrow{f} Y ) \mapsto %
      \left ( (\cI^X)_+ \myrightarrow{\cJ(f_*)} (\cI^Y)_+ \right),
    \end{gather*}
    where the functor $\cJ(f_*)$ may be described as
    \begin{displaymath}
      % TODO add arrow Y \to \cI above
      (c: X \to \cI) \mapsto %
      \left\{ %
        \begin{array}{c} %
        Y \myrightarrow{} \cI, \\ %
        y \mapsto \coprod\limits_{x \in f^{-1}(y)} c(x) %
        \end{array} %
       \right\}.
    \end{displaymath}
    For two composable maps of sets $X \myrightarrow{f} Y \myrightarrow{g} Z$ the structure natural transformation $\cJ(g) \circ \cJ(Y) \to \cJ(g \circ f)$ is given as a reordering: On $c_x \in (\cI^X)_+$, we map (omitting from the notation that the sums are taken over all tuples with $f(x)=y$ and $g(y)=z$, respectively)
    \begin{gather*}
    % TODO substitute the categories with the actual objects!
      \cI_+ L (g_*) \circ \cI_+ L (f_*) (c_x)  %
        \crightarrow{2}{\phi^{\cI_+}_{L(g_*),L(f_*)}} %
      \cI_+( L(g_*) \circ L(f_*)) (c_x)%
        \crightarrow{2}{\cI_+(\phi^L_{g_*,f_*})} %
      \cI_+ L (g \circ f)_* (c_x)\\
      \left[\coprod_{(y,g(y))} %
        \left( \coprod_{(x,f(x))} c_x \right)  \right]_{z \in Z} \crightarrow{2}{} %
      \left[ \coprod_{((x,f(x)),(y,gf(y)))} c_x \right]_{z \in Z} \crightarrow{2}{} %
      \left[ \coprod_{(x,gf(x))} c_x \right]_{z \in Z}
      % \left[\coprod_{(y,g(y)) \in pr_2^{-1}(z)} %
      %   \left( \coprod_{(x,f(x)) \in pr_2^{-1}(y)} c_x \right)  \right]_{z \in Z} \to %
      % \left[ \coprod_{(x,f(x),gf(x)) \in (pr_2 pr_2)^{-1}(z)} c_x \right]_{z \in Z} \to %
      % \left[ \coprod_{(x,gf(x)) \in pr_2^{-1}(z)} c_x \right]_{z \in Z}
    \end{gather*}
    first via the natural bijection between the two indexing sets, and then by projecting away from the middle coordinate, which in this case is a bijection.
    The identity 1-arrow structure morphism on a finite set $X$, $\phi^{\cJ(-)_*}_X = \cI_+(\phi^{L}_X) \circ \phi^{\cI_+}_{L(X)}: 1_{\cJ(X)} \to \cJ(1_X)$, is the composition of two isomorphisms, and hence an isomorphism itself.\\
    On the other hand, taking the contravariant inclusion $\Fin \to V$ which sends a map $f:X \to Y$ to the class of spans $ f^* = [ Y \myleftarrow{f} X = X]$, results in the functor $\cJ(f^*): (\cI^Y)_+ \to (\cI^X)_+$ sending a tuple $(c_y)_{y \in Y}$ to the tuple $y \mapsto \coprod_{(f(x),x) \in pr_2^{-1}(x)} c_{f(x)}$, where the last coproduct is take over a singleton set and is hence naturally isomorphic to $c_{f(x)}$. Thus the last functor may naturally be described as precomposition with $f$. A study the involved maps shows, as above, that the structure morphisms are indeed isomorphisms.

      commutes, with $\alpha$ indicating the appropriate associativity morphisms. For $b \in \cB_0$,
      \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{xy}
          \xymatrix{
            & F^\prime(\id_b) \circ \sigma_b

        \end{xy}
      \end{displaymath}
      is required to commmute.\\
      Dually, a \emph{right lax transformation} consists of
      \begin{itemize}
        \item for every object $b \in \cB_0$ a 1-morphism $F(b) \myrightarrow{\rho_b} F^\prime(b)$ in $\cC$
        \item for every 1-morphism $f: b \to b^\prime$ a 2-morphism $F^\prime(f) \circ \rho_b \myleftarrow{\rho_f} \rho_{b^\prime} \circ F(f)$.
        \end{itemize}
      Observe the reversed direction:
      \begin{displaymath}
        \xymatrix{
          F(b)
            \ar[r]^{\rho_b}
            \ar[d]_{F(f)}
            \ar@{}[dr]|*\objectbox{\rotatebox{225}{$\Leftarrow$}}
          &
          F^\prime(b)
            \ar[d]^{F^\prime(f)}
          \\
          F(b^\prime) 
            \ar[r]_{\rho_{b^\prime}}
          &
          F^\prime(b^\prime)
        }
      \end{displaymath}
      This data is also subject to composition and unit relations, which we omit to display as they are analogous to the two above diagrams.

    \begin{lem}\label{lem_loday_functor_preserves_connectivity}
      The Loday functor (at a finite set) preserves connectivity of commutative ring spectra, sends stable equivalences to point-wise equivalences (check this statement!) and [comparison to smash product].
      \begin{proof}
        depends on connectivity of a map $S^1 \wedge A(S^n) \to A(S^{n+1})$ - corresponding map in orthogonal spectra context should be structure map. check definition of transformation $G^A$ or rather transformation $A$! Connection of connectivity to ``functors of simplicial sets''?
      \end{proof}
    \end{lem}

    \begin{cor}\label{cor_loday_at_S_naturally_equivalent_to_tensor_with_S}
      Let $A$ be a cofibrant? flat? \hring, then Loday of $A$ at $S$ is stably equivalent as a spectrum to $S \otimes A$, and the morphisms are natural in $S$.

    A bicategory $\mathcal{C}$ is in part made up of a class of 0-cells, and for any two zero-cells $A,B$ a category $\mathcal{C}(A,B)$, whose objects form the 1-cells from $A$ to $B$ and whose morphisms form the 2-cells between two given 1-cells. The bicategory of spans $W$ has 0-cells all finite cells. Given finite sets $X,Y$ the 1-cells are given as spans $ X \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y$ for some finite set $A$, and a 2-cell between two spans from $X$ to $Y$  is given as the vertical map in the following commutative diagram:
    \[
    \xymatrix@R-=.5em{
      %
      &
      %
      A \ar[dl] \ar[dd] \ar[dr]
      %
      \\
      X
      &
      %

      %
      &
      A^\prime \ar[ul] \ar[ur]
      &
      %
    }
    \]
    Horizontal composition is given by a functorial and conrete choice of pullback applied to the 1-cells and taking the map induced by the 2-cells between pullbacks,

    \comm{[make clearer or scratch - this should explain horizontal composition of 2-cells!]}

    while vertical composition is composition of maps.\\
    The bicategory $\operatorname{Cat}$ of small categories has small categories as 0-cells, functors as 1-cells and natural transformations as 2-cells.
